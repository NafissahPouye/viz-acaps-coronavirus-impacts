Increased alcohol or substance use (or abuse) can be both factors of government measures and behavioural changes. For instance government restrictive measures place people in a state where they cannot practice usual activities in-turn rising stress levels.

Negative impacts have risen from border closures which has limited trade flows in agricultural inputs which normally would be imported from neighboring countries. This is expected to result in decreased area planted, less/fewer agricultural labor opportunities and below average season B production. Due to slowed down domestic trade in both rural and urban areas, farmers (rural farmers) may find it difficult to sell their goods therefore resulting in lower income from sales. Movement restrictions and reduced global demand has led foreign currency shortages due to the reduction in exports of tobacco, coffee, cacao and industrial metals. This has resulted in the increase in prices of good. Maize prices in Kinshasa in July were  reported nearly 80% higher than it was in February. \nSupply chains and market functioning are being disrupted with the reduction in the availability of food and non-food products. The rising market prices and decline in the availability and access to food is contributing to the deterioration in food and nutrition security.",

With the current limitation of information and data about COVID-19s impact on child marriage, countries like the DRC can draw valuable information from experiences of other pandemics such as Ebola. These experiences suggest that girls and women are the ones adversely affected by such a crisis especially those who find themselves within poor households and marginalized groups. Child marriage is often driven by circumstances where family and community structures are broken down during a crisis and displacement. Child marriage will therefore be driven by the challenges the pandemic will create such as the loss of household income, higher risk of violence in the household and lack of access to schooling. Therefore child marriage will be seen as patching these challenges in order to overcome them. In other instances, marriage is supposedly seen as protection from for girls and their families from the social stigma that can result from surviving rape or sexual assault. The specific drivers of child marriage are therefore poverty, pandemics, adolescent pregnancy and armed conflict.",

Displacement of people in the eastern and northern DRC are often led by the following of brutal attacks by various armed groups, intercommunal violence and natural disasters. Furthermore, the country hosts over half a million refugees from Rwanda, Burundi, the Central African Republic and South Sudan. The covid-19 pandemic and government measures further aggravates the risk faced by displaced families who are unable to return home to the ongoing violence in the country forcing them to live in overcrowded displacement sites.  \nIn addition the DRC in April 2020 had an amount of 5010000 internally displaced people however not specifically stated if it is in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Globally it has been stated that the covid 19 pandemic is having catastrophic secondary impacts on the health of women and girls.

These measures have resulted in the denial of care for women and girls together with delays in getting the services they need. In a country like the DRC such decrease in access to sexual and reproductive may lead in the rise of mortality and violation of human rights leading to more conflicts in the country. For instance a significant lesson from the West Africa Ebola outbreak of 2014-2016 is that the biggest threat to womenâ€™s and girlsâ€™ lives was not the Ebola virus, but the shutdown of routine health services and peopleâ€™s fear of going to health facilities where they could get infected",

As there is a debate about whether patients should skip surgery and/or treatment to avoid exposure to COVID-19, their conditions could further diminish due to the cancer. The authors mainly emphasize that if the healthcare system mismanages the situation, then it could effect patients such as those with cancer negatively. The article doesn't necessarily claim that oncology in Iran is already effected, but that \"Cancer care is specifically facing innumerable challenges in our country.\" These challenges can lead to mismanagement, which could lead to lives being lost. The article does not mention any other curative or non-essential health services. There are also not any other news reports or articles available for Iran for this indicator at the moment, and therefore obtains 'medium' reliability.  It is also 'undetermined' who has influenced the indicator as the article only considers the healthcare system that are in charge of the decisions and does not mention the governmental influences.",

However it should be noted that there are news reports that came out in 2019 stating that there is a shortage of medical supplies due to the sanctions (article is linked). Given that this came out in 2019 (before the declaration of the pandemic), the reports therefore refer to medical supplies other than for COVID-19. Given that there was already a shortage then, one could assume that the shortage could have gone over and/or worsen in 2020 because of the pandemic. One should also consider that many European countries provided aid to Iran which could have lessen the impact. There is therefore many factors to consider but no report specifically mentions a shortage of medical supplies not in priority of COVID-19, which causes this indicator to have an infogap.",

By knowing this, it was possible to see from both the published and unofficial reports that there is a higher COVID-19 fatality rate in Iranâ€™s non-Persian provinces than the Persian concentrated center. This trend is consistent with the fact that there are less hospital beds available in the non-persian provinces (that is lower below the national average). In Persian populated provinces there are more beds available than the national average. The Iranian health system averages 155 hospital beds for every 100,000 people. Some of the non-Persian provinces who have averages below that average includes  the Azerbaijani populated provinces (140 beds), in the Baluch (99 beds) and Kurd (143 beds) populated provinces. In contrast, Persian populated provinces have over 200 beds (which is above the average). It is therefore clear that ethnic minority groups (i.e. non-Persians) have less access to medical equipment such as hospital beds, which directly correlates with the higher mortality rate among the Iranian minorities.",

Other ethnic minorities are Kurds, Baluchis, and Arabs, in addition to non-Shiâ€™a and non-Muslim religious minorities. These minorities have faced greater discrimination during COVID-19 and an example thereof was during the releasing of prisoners in March of 2020. To quote: \"...during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic, prisoners in Tehran were prioritized, and therefore ethnic minorities were far less likely to see freedom.\" The Persians in Iran were prioritized over the minorities in other prisons for release (release for fear of spreading of COVID-19). Although the release of prisoners is overall controversial, those who were prioritized received greater benefits than the minority prisoners who are now at greater risk of being exposed to COVID-19. Furthermore the report also talks about the Afghan refugees, that also make up for minorities in Iran. They are restricted in their movement, even before the pandemic, as 27/31 of the provinces ban residence of Afghans. It is unsure whether discrimination has increased towards the refugees since the pandemic.",

An app called \"Toranj\", that helps report domestic violence, has seen 847 more users in \"the past month\" (March-April). This figure is four times as much as the combined number of users in January and February (210). Therefore suggesting a surge in the number of domestic violence cases since the pandemic. Another media article (linked in alternative source) indicated how children (those from low-income households) might also be experiencing an increase in abuse and violence as they cannot provide their small-incomes anymore. Furthermore it also stated that the increase in domestic abuse is also caused by the government as there is lack of support for women/children in domestic abuse in Iran.",

    "Justification": "The executive director of the Family Health Association Iran (FHA Iran) held an interview providing some insight into the sexual and reproductive services available in Iran during the pandemic. Usually there are sexual and reproductive healthcare (SRH) services such as contraception, safe abortion, HIV/AIDS and STI treatment, gynecology and obstetrics services available in Iran- for vulnerable groups. These services are provided through static and integrated clinics- and usually there are \"six static and integrated clinics, and one mobile clinic. Since the outbreak we have been able to provide SRHR services via three static clinics, and one outreach team.\" Therefore the amount of clinics available have decreased in Iran. What is even more notable is that the Family Health Association (FHA) are restricted in providing these services: \"We are only allowed to provide contraceptives for vulnerable groups such as refugees, sex workers, substance users, and people living with HIV.\" Contraceptives are not allowed to be given to Iranian people (who are not vulnerable) due to government regulations that aims to combat Iran's decreasing population. It would seem that Iranian people are in anyway restricted in using sexual and reproductive services- irrespective of the pandemic. According to the article midwifery services that require a physical presence have also been hard hit in Iran. Furthermore, the U.S. sanctions have also limited funding which affected staff salaries and equipment for providing these services. I also labelled the affect that COVID-19 has on the indicator as 'behavioral' since: \"It would seem during crisis settings, SRHR becomes less of a priority for people. They are more concerned with remaining safe and free from the virus.\" People are therefore less likely to reach out to the services provided due to the virus. Another article (from June) has stated that 50,000 IUDs have been stuck in Dubai's port for nearly 3 months that are supposed to be delivered to Iran. It therefore indicates that there might be a shortage in these contraceptives in Iran-irrespective if its only available to vulnerable people. Overall, I am giving the source a medium reliability as this report stems from April and it is unsure whether these services are made available yet.",

This is because Iran holds 240,000 prisoners in jails which were designed for about 150,000 prisoners. It is obvious that overcrowding in the jails will cause the virus to spread rapidly. The author of the article mentions how letting prisoners leave early is a huge step for Iran, who is a country that usually heavily relies on imprisonment. The article states that although it was initially announced that 54,000 prisoners should be released, it would seem that nearly 100,000 prisoners were actually released.",

They are apparently working 392 hours per month which goes against the international standard of 175 per month, while many have not been paid. This resulted in many protests (mostly held by nurses) across the country due to the economic problems. The State Security forces (SSF) responded with attacking the protesters using \"batons and electric shockers to disperse the nurses\".  In my opinion the protests, and therefore the violence, would not have occurred if it was not for the pandemic. Therefore an increase in violence against nurses/medical staff is experienced from government measures, even though there are very few articles/reports so far.",

This condition, associated with lower levels of social protection and difficulties in accessing hospitals, increases the probability of presenting a high rate of morbidity in this group. At the end of 2019, the informal employment rate in Mexico reached 56.2%. This means that the majority of workers in the country lack protection via social security, benefits, savings funds for housing or retirement, and are more likely to maintain lower wages than formal workers. Women in the informal sector are the group with the lowest wages and the most affected by lay-offs.",

However, these restrictions appear to have only delayed possible migrations.\nAlso, during the pandemic, the United States and Mexico tightened measures to curb the entry of migrants.
